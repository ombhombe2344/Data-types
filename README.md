# Data Types in C++

## Aim
To study and implement C++ program structures.

## Apparatus
VS Code

## Theory
In C++, data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold.Some of them are int-integer type char-character type float-single precision floating type. etc. These types come in signed and unsigned variants, enabling both positive and negative values, or solely non-negative values, respectively. Each type of data takes up different amount of bytes.
